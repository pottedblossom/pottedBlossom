When I was a kid my mom would take me to the greenhouse and we would pick out flowers to plant in her flower beds. I loved taking these little plants and watching them grow through out the season. This love of plants continued to grow through out my teenage years. 

When I went to college it took me a couple of years but I finally found the perfect degree for me. I graduated with a degree in Horticulture from Brigham Young University-Idaho and started working at a greenhouse in Idaho Falls, Idaho. 

In the last nine years I have found how much I enjoy working in a greenhouse and helping people plan and pick flowers for their yard. My favorite job as been the last five years of experience in designing and putting together customers flower pots. 

Throughout college and the years since I have had an idea for my own potting business in the background. This business would be one were I would work with customers to help them find that perfect combination of flowers to brighten put up their yard. It is a business that works hard to put orders together in a timely manner and to craft each on with care.  I am excited to move forward with the Potted Blossom and providing you with beautiful creation for your home.
