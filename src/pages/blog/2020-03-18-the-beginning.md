They say the beginning is a very good place to start but sometimes the start is a hard place to find. The idea for the Potted Blossom has been kicking around in the back of my head for a few years. 

Originally I wanted to open a floral shop and to design beautiful bouquets for everyone who walked through my door. Then I did my internships. The first one was at a Greenhouse in Idaho Falls, Idaho. I loved it! Then I started my second internship, this time at a floral shop in Jackson, Wyoming. It was very enjoyable but I soon realized that owning a floral shop wasn't what I was wanting to do. 

The following summer I returned to work at the greenhouse in Idaho Falls and started to realize that it was more in line with what I enjoyed. I also visited Thanksgiving Point in Utah for the first time and fell in love with the gardens there. This was the start of my dream for something like the Potted Blossom. It was an idea that I figured I'd have to hold off on until I was quite a bit older but I could enjoy dreaming. 

It's only been about nine years since then but I've decided to start building up the Potted Blossom.  I came to the realization that I didn't have to put my dream off until I was older. There are things I can do now to accomplish my end goal. 

So, what is my end goal? My end goal is to have a greenhouse that will store and care for peoples hanging baskets and containers that they come in and plant. This would give them the opportunity to start celebrating spring even if the ground is still covered in snow. 

I will also have room for container that are brought in for me to design and plant. 

Right now I don't have the ability to build a greenhouse  or to store containers but I do have the ability to design and plant containers for those that need it. That is my first step with the Potted Blossom. This year I am offering my potting services.

I'm excited to take this step and to watch my dream become a reality, one little step at a time.
